# 🥔 Introduction
Ampas Management System (AMS) is a personal project designed to streamline and manage the selling process of soybean dregs (ampas). It simplifies daily operations by providing an efficient way to track sales and manage records.

AMS is a desktop application built with Tauri, leveraging its lightweight, secure, and cross-platform capabilities for an optimal native experience. The frontend is developed using React Router v7 as a framework, utilizing its modern routing and data APIs for a clean, maintainable client-side architecture—without the complexity of server-side rendering (SSR).

On the backend, AMS uses:

- 🚒 Diesel, a type-safe and efficient query builder for Rust.
- 🐟 Sea-query, providing flexible and easy-to-manage database migrations.
- 🩹 React Router V7, modern routing with Suspense Feature.

The goal of AMS is to deliver a simple, fast, and reliable system tailored for personal use in managing the daily sales operations of soybean dregs.

    UStart(start for user)-->UA
    UA[user select their name] --> UB[user insert how much they take]
    UB --> UC[UI get back to dashboard and showing data how much user take]

    OpenHiddenMenu[open hidden menu button and enter admin password]
    OpenHiddenMenu --> Menu{what menu does admin click? lets use tab UI}

        for user
    ]

    Report --> ReportDescription[
        admin able to generate report for some duration

        table how many user take for each day including
        date detail
    ]

    ChangeDregPrice --> ChangeDregPriceDescription[
        admin able to change dreg price, dreg price 
        will record on database, and admin able to view all

### 🎻 Current UI to Remind

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c6aefd0-7fb6-483a-9f84-94861e6f396f)
  
- 21 Januari 2025, running browser on raspberry pi zero 2 was to slow, even you don't start dotnet backend yet. after searching tauri seem solve this, but with consequence changing backend into tauri (rust).
- 24 Februari 2025, 👷‍♂️ TODO create diesel migration and sea-query table builder combination, create macro to automate sea-query table function creation from struct model
- 25 Februari 2025, turn out diesel was sync (because its made before async in rust), for current case its ok to use sync.
- 8 Maret 2025, Create Basic structure of CRUD with Rust in ProductRepository
- 🌳 TODO: Implement DatabaseMetadata function with diesel.
- 🌳 TODO: create list of needed command for ui
- 🌳 TODO: create list of response name model for ui
- 🌳 TODO: create UI mockup
- 🌳 TODO: create needed query for command
- 🌳 TODO: create list logic for UI
- 🌳 TODO: add mobx 

</details>


## 🎏 Useful Notes 

- running cargo test -> `cargo test test_insert_product -- --nocapture`
- get expanded macro for debugging -> `cargo expand --lib  model::product`
- react router Revalidate for refetching data and route
- usestate with zustand to update ui only
- to run vitest with ui and watch mode `yarn test --ui --watch`
